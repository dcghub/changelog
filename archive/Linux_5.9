Linux 5.9 [[https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAHk-=wi-u86++np80GQvgDuARdt9xpBNho6SjHLmYgm8jibGag@mail.gmail.com/T/#u|has been released]] on Sun, 11 Oct 2020.

Summary: This release implements better management of anonymous (malloc'ed) memory; a new cgroup slab controller that improves slab utilization by allowing memory cgroups to share slab memory; support for proactive memory defragmentation; CPU Capacity awareness for the deadline scheduling class; support for running BPF programs on socket lookups; new close_range() system call for easier closing of entire ranges of file descriptors, support for FSGSBASE x86 instructions that provide faster context switching, NFS support for extended attributes; and support for ZSTD compressed kernel, ramdisk and initramfs. As always, there are many other new drivers and improvements.

<<TableOfContents()>>
= Prominent Features =
== Better management of anonymous memory ==

This release implements better workload detection and protection of anonymous memory (memory that is not file-backed, ie. malloc'ed memory). The Linux kernel manages the memory of anonymous memory placing its pages in either the active list or inactive list. Under memory pressure, unused pages are moved from the active to the inactive list and unmapped, giving them a chance of being referenced again (aka: soft fault) before being moved to swap, if there is more pressure.

In the previous implementation, newly created or swap-in pages were placed on the active list, which could force actively used pages to the inactive list. In this release, newly created or swap-in anonoymous pages are started in the inactive list (thus protecting existing hot workloads), and only promoted to the active list when they are referenced enough. Aditionally, because this change can also cause newly created or swap-in anonymous pages to swap-out existing pages in the inactive list, the existing workingset detection mechanisms have been extended to deal with the anonymous LRU list to make more optimal decisions.

== New cgroup slab controller shares slab memory ==

The cgroup slab memory controller was based on the idea of replicating slab allocator internals for each memory cgroup, so those cgroups didn't share slab memory, which lead to low slab utilization and higher slab memory usage. The slab controller used to be an opt-int feature, but today it's enabled by default in the memory controller, and modern systems with systemd create many cgroups, so these ineffiencies affect many people.

This release incorporats a new cgroup slab memory controller that allows to share slab memory between memory cgroups. For Facebook, it saved significant amount of memory, measured from high hundreds of MBs to single GBs per host; on average the size of slab memory was reduced by 35-45%. Desktop systems also benefit: on a 16GB Fedora system, the new slab controller saves ~45-50% of slab memory, measured just after loading of the system.

== Proactive memory compaction ==

Huge Pages (ie. pages bigger than 4KB on x86) are a processor feature that can improve performance due to reduced TLB usage. Making use of these pages requires having large amounts of contiguous free memory, which can difficult to obtain when memory is heavily fragmented. Linux supports memory compaction (ie. defragmentation), but it is only triggered when a huge page needs to be allocated, which can take time and hence hurts allocation latency. This release adds support for proactive memory compaction, that is, automatically triggering memory compaction before doing any allocation, so that future allocations can succeed faster.

== New close_range() system call for easier closing of file descriptors ==

This release incorporates a new system call, close_range(2). It allows to efficiently close a range of file descriptors up to all file descriptors of a calling task. Eg, {{{close_range(3, ~0U);}}} will close all descriptors past stderr. It turns out, quite a bunch of projects need to do exactly that: service managers, libcs, container runtimes, programming language runtimes/standard libraries (Rust/Python). This system call has been coordinated with FreeBSD, so it is also available there.

== Support for running BPF programs on socket lookups ==

As with every new version, there are many improvements to BPF. An interesting new feature is a new BPF program type named {{{BPF_PROG_TYPE_SK_LOOKUP}}}, which runs when transport layer is looking up a listening socket for a new connection request (TCP), or when looking up an unconnected socket for a packet (UDP). This serves as a mechanism to overcome the limits of the bind() API. Two use-cases driving this work are: 1) steer packets destined to an IP range, fixed port to a single socket, 2) steer packets destined to an IP address, any port to a single socket.

== CPU Capacity awareness for the deadline scheduling class ==

Since [[https://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_3.14#Deadline_scheduling_class_for_better_real-time_scheduling|Linux 3.14]] the Linux task scheduler supports a [[https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/scheduler/sched-deadline.html|deadline scheduling class]], designed around real-time concepts for applications that need strict time requirements. This scheduling class was not aware of the existence of heterogeneous platforms where CPUs have not the same performance (ie. ARM big.LITTLE), which leads to wrong scheduling decisions. This release makes the deadline class aware of the capacity of each CPU.

== Faster context switch with supports FSGSBASE x86 instructions ==

The FSGSBASE instructions are an Intel feature that has been available for a long time. They allow direct access to the FS and FS segment base registers. In addition to benefits to applications, performance improvements to the OS context switch code are possible by making use of these instructions

== NFS support for extended attributes ==

This release incorporates support for extended attributes ([[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8276|RFC 8276]]), which bridges one of the most relevant gaps in NFS. 


== Support for ZSTD compressed kernel, ramdisk and initramfs ==
This release adds support for a ZSTD-compressed kernel, ramdisk, and initramfs in the kernel boot process (ZSTD-compressed ramdisk and initramfs are supported on all architectures, the ZSTD-compressed kernel is only hooked up to x86 for now). ZSTD offers good compression rates and very high decompression speeds. When Facebook switched from a xz compressed initramfs to a zstd compressed initramfs decompression time shrunk from 12 seconds to 3 seconds. When they switched from a xz compressed kernel to a zstd compressed kernel they saved 2 seconds of boot time.

= Core (various) =
 * Task scheduler
  * (FEATURED) CPU Capacity awareness for SCHED_DEADLINE class, which now attempts to avoid missing task deadlines due to smaller CPU (e.g. big.LITTLE systems) not being capable enough to finish a task in time. This is only supported for now in the idle scenario [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/c81b89329933c6c0be809d4c0d2cb57c49153ee3|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/fc9dc698472aa460a8b3b036d9b1d0b751f12f58|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/60ffd5edc5e4fa69622c125c54ef8e7d5d894af8|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/b4118988fdcb4554ea6687dd8ff68bcab690b8ea|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/23e71d8ba42933bff12e453858fd68c073bc5258|commit]]
  * uclamp: Add a new sysctl to control RT default boost value. On battery powered devices, it is desired to control this default (currently hardcoded) behavior at runtime to reduce energy consumed by RT tasks [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/13685c4a08fca9dd76bf53bfcbadc044ab2a08cb|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/1f73d1abe5836bd8ffe747ff5cb7561b17ce5bc6|commit]]

 * fanotify: report events with names. With these you can now efficiently monitor whole filesystem, eg to mirror changes to another machine. Two new group flags: {{{FAN_REPORT_NAME}}}, which reports the parent fid and name for directory entry modification events (create/detete/move) and for events on non-directory objects; and {{{FAN_REPORT_DIR_FID}}} which report unique directory id in some cases [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/08b95c338e0c5a96e47f4ca314ea1e7580ecb5d7|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/0badfa029e5fd6d5462adb767937319335637c83|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/103ff6a554923e0da54e0a28a686c91facf5bffd|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/6ad1aadd970460d81d5e803ac38c0f63f85c0a00|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/d809daf1b6add51eec001bf60b17885d697a299d|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/3ef866536645ce1b4f0516e8723d803d0fa6ca26|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/4ed6814a91cc71202e3de12cd1cb7cc59f3cee57|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/85af5d9258cc5862167c578c63c65ac700a3fa19|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/6ba8d7107f27c1bde60a80bc5def027979af3e8e|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/f454fa610a69b93e7ed4de739e736f988d95c2d2|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/f35c41567867e06bb0a1d6b74c5bf323be1026e5|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/62cb0af4cea871e80015dd45b200033002f23a95|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/c8f3446c66d810e21af61cf889e7b0e3bc921b9d|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/497b0c5a7c0688c1b100a9c2e267337f677c198e|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/82ace1efb3cb1d49a1681cc6e31156047d5ae1f2|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/40a100d3adc1ad7f0a34875468c499fcecd20ba4|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/957f7b472c6b6de4214bf5144b811ab83a9b9465|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/7dbe6080167860df0bf8627e55fd5154f366cc7a|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/9b93f33105f5f9bd3d016ff870eb6000c9d89eff|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/79cb299c7e181fad683bf6191edb8224b2412512|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/83b7a59896dd24015a34b7f00027f0ff3747972f|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/5128063739d293b9faf8ffaa9a5dfd622bc954f5|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/929943b38daf817f2e6d303ea04401651fc3bc05|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/7e8283af6edeb7dd9f8f18a429e6738c07f00ce4|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/691d976352c73f9b55486092625adbcedd5ca5c5|commit]]

 * (FEATURED) Implement workingset protection and detection on the anonymous LRU page list. In the previous implementation, newly created or swap-in anonymous (ie. malloc'ed) page were started on the active list, which can demote pages being actively used to the inactive list. In this release, newly created or swap-in anonoymous pages are started in the inactive list, and only promoted to the active list when they are referenced enough. Aditionally, because these changes can cause newly created or swap-in anonymous pages to swap-out existing pages in the inactive list, workingset detection has been extended to deal with the anonymous LRU list to make more optimal decisions [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/ccc5dc67340c109e624e07e02790e9fbdec900d6|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/b518154e59aab3ad0780a169c5cc84bd4ee4357e|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/170b04b7ae49634df103810dad67b22cf8a99aa6|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/3852f6768ede542ed48b9077bedf482c7ecb6327|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/aae466b0052e1888edd1d7f473d4310d64936196|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/4002570c5c585c4c9a889e45dd104ed663257eec|commit]]

Once force-detached, BPF link stays valid in the kernel as long as there is at least one FD open against it [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/73b11c2ab072d5b0599d1e12cc126f55ee306daf|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/2e49527e52486dac910460b1b3f6fce6e21c6b48|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/90806ccc90bbd0150267a97ae4003269597a6a6c|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/0e8c7c07f090668566db2030a027a360ffd00938|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/e85f99aa7760e74bb5a7e8515948f99c264a275f|commit]]

  * Support 'start disabled', 'enable' and 'disable' external control commands which can be provided for stat and record modes of the tool from an external controlling process. 'start disabled' command can be used to postpone enabling of events in the beginning of a monitoring session. 'enable' and 'disable' commands can be used to enable and disable events correspondingly any time after the start of the session. The 'start disabled', 'enable' and 'disable' external control commands can be used to focus measurement on specially selected time intervals of workload execution. Focused measurement reduces tool intrusion and influence on workload behavior, reduces distortion and amount of collected and stored data, mitigates data accuracy loss because measurement and data capturing happen only during intervals of interest
