= Coolest features =
== New version 5.0 ==
This release increases the major version number to 5. This change does not mean anything and does not affect programs in any way, it just makes Linus happy.

== Energy-aware Scheduling for Arm big.LITTLE ==
This release includes the energy-aware scheduling feature, which lets the task scheduler to take scheduling decisions that will result in lower power usage on asymmetric SMP platforms - such as waking up tasks to the more energy-efficient CPUs first. This feature is important to achieve better power management in phones using Arm's big.LITTLE CPUs. This feature is a simplified version of the energy-aware scheduling that is currently part of the AOSP Common Kernel.

== Adiantum file system encryption for low power devices ==

This release adds support for the Adiantum encryption. Note that this encryption mode is not added to ecryptfs but to fscrypt, the kernel funcionality which filesystems (currently ext4, f2fs and ubifs) can hook into to support transparent encryption of files and directories.

Adiantum was developed to provide filesystem encryption for low-end Android devices that lack AES instructions. On ARM Cortex-A7, on 4096-byte messages Adiantum encryption is about 4 times faster than AES-256-XTS encryption; decryption is about 5 times faster. See the [[https://security.googleblog.com/2019/02/introducing-adiantum-encryption-for.html|google security blog]] or the [[https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/720.pdf|Adiantum paper]] for more details.

== Support for AMDGPU FreeSync ==

This release adds support for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeSync|FreeSync]], an adaptive synchronization technology for LCDs that support a dynamic refresh rate, aimed at providing a low monitor latency and a smooth, virtually stutter-free viewing experience. It also helps improve battery life by reducing the refresh rate of the panel when not receiving new images.

Variable refresh rate capable displays can dynamically adjust their refresh rate by extending the duration of their vertical front porch until page flip or timeout occurs. This can reduce or remove stuttering and latency in scenarios where the page flip does not align with the vblank interval. An example scenario would be an application flipping at a constant rate of 48Hz on a 60Hz display. The page flip will frequently miss the vblank interval and the same contents will be displayed twice. This can be observed as stuttering for content with motion. If variable refresh rate was active on a display that supported a variable refresh range from 35Hz to 60Hz no stuttering would be observable for the example scenario.

== UDP Generic Receive Offload and MSG_ZEROCOPY support ==

This release adds support of GRO (Generic Receive Offload) in the UDP implementation. A new sockopt ({{{UDP_GRO}}}) has been added to enable GRO support. Future enachements will enable UDP GSO offload on more virtual devices eventually even on forwarded packets.

This release also expands {{{MSG_ZEROCOPY}}} support for UDP. Recommended LWN article: [[https://lwn.net/Articles/726917/|Zero-copy networking]]

== Support cpuset resource controller in cgroupv2 ==

The cpuset controller provides a mechanism for constraining the CPU and memory node placement of tasks to only the resources specified in the cpuset interface files in a task's current cgroup. This is especially valuable on large NUMA systems where placing jobs on properly sized subsets of the systems with careful processor and memory placement to reduce cross-node memory access and contention can improve overall system performance.

This release enables cpuset controller in cgroup v2, with a minimal set of features.

== Btrfs swap file support ==
Btrfs removed support for swap files a decade ago. However, now the proper restrictions are in place, Btrfs can support swap files. The swap file must be fully allocated as "nocow" with no compression on one device.

== binderfs, a binder filesystem to run multiple instances of Android ==

This release includes binderfs, a pseudo-filesystem for the Android Binder IPC driver. Each ipc namespace will mount a new binderfs instance. It is backwards compatible, and it allows to run multiple of Android. Each binderfs mount initially only contains a binder-control device. It can be used to dynamically allocate new binder IPC devices via ioctls.

Code: [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/3ad20fe393b31025bebfc2d76964561f65df48aa|commit]]

== ARM pointer authentication ==

The ARMv8.3 Pointer Authentication extension adds primitives that can be used to mitigate certain classes of attack where an attacker can corrupt the contents of some memory (e.g. the stack). The extension uses a Pointer Authentication Code (PAC) to determine whether pointers have been modified unexpectedly. A PAC is derived from a pointer, another value (such as the stack pointer), and a secret key held in system registers.

The extension adds instructions to insert a valid PAC into a pointer, and to verify/remove the PAC from a pointer. The PAC occupies a number of high-order bits of the pointer, which varies dependent on the configured virtual address size and whether pointer tagging is in use. A subset of these instructions have been allocated from the HINT encoding space. In the absence of the extension (or when disabled), these instructions behave as NOPs. Applications and libraries using these instructions operate correctly regardless of the presence of the extension.

  * Support raw tracepoints in modules [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/a38d1107f937ca95dcf820161ef44ea683d6a0b1|commit]]
  * Add perf-based event notification for sock_ops. The eBPF kernel module can thus be designed to apply any desired filters to the bpf_sock_ops and trigger a perf-event notification based on the verdict from the filter. The uspace component can use these perf-event notifications to either read any state managed by the eBPF kernel module, or issue a TCP_INFO netlink call if desired [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/a5a3a828cd00788a78da686c57c6d1f66191d8af|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/435f90a338ae42c0d7c0109a1742d1b16bc99bf6|commit]]

= Security =
 * Add seccomp trap to userspace. It introduces a means for syscalls matched in seccomp to notify some other task that a particular filter has been triggered. The motivation for this is primarily for use with containers. For example, if a container does an init_module(), we obviously don't want to load this untrusted code, which may be compiled for the wrong version of the kernel anyway. Instead, we could parse the module image, figure out which module the container is trying to load and load it on the host. As another example, containers cannot mknod(), since this checks capable(CAP_SYS_ADMIN). However, harmless devices like /dev/null or /dev/zero should be ok for containers to mknod, but we'd like to avoid hard coding some whitelist in the kernel. Another example is mount(), which has many security restrictions for good reason, but configuration or runtime knowledge could potentially be used to relax these restrictions.

 * VRF: allow simultaneous service instances in default and other VRFs. It provides this isolation for stream sockets subject to the existing kernel parameter {{{net.ipv4.tcp_l3mdev_accept}}} not being set, given that this is documented as allowing a single service instance to work across all VRF domains. Similarly, {{{net.ipv4.udp_l3mdev_accept}}} is checked for datagram sockets, and {{{net.ipv4.raw_l3mdev_accept}}} is introduced for raw sockets. The functionality applies to UDP & TCP services as well as those using raw sockets, and is for IPv4 and IPv6 [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/3c82a21f4320c8d54cf6456b27c8d49e5ffb722e|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/e78190581aff7c96fbd6324aa633170934650b65|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/6da5b0f027a825df2aebc1927a27bda185dc03d4|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/6897445fb194c8ad046df4a13e1ee9f080a5a21e|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/7055420fb6a1cb754a64be99ddcabd45bd902d99|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/6f12fa775530195a501fb090d092c637f32d0cc5|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/d839a0ebeb4e81a4f2923f581c28b41e1238bdfe|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/5226b6a920ba78d9fbcbb843388d2a844a1fa1c8|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/7bd2db404efa3daff700e8c88561b435611d07a5|commit]]

 * Add support for speculation barrier instruction As part of the fallout from specdown and meltre, Armv8.5 introduces an architected Speculation Barrier (SB) instruction. Unlike CSDB, this is not retrofitted to existing CPUs, so we need to plumb in an HWCAP and make use of the alternatives framework to patch it over our current DSB; ISB sequence on CPUs that support it [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/bd4fb6d270bc423a9a4098108784f7f9254c4e6d|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/679db70801da9fda91d26caf13bf5b5ccc74e8e8|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/8cb3451b1f240ec4d36a9bfcd39cb6d59769a5b3|commit]]
 * Add support for 52-bit userspace VAs to systems that have ARMv8.2-LVA and are running with a 48-bit VA_BITS and a 64KB page size. If no hardware support is present, the kernel runs with a 48-bit VA space for userspace. Userspace can exploit this feature by providing an address hint to mmap where addr[51:48] != 0. Otherwise all the VA mappings will behave in the same way as a 48-bit VA system (this is to maintain compatibility with software that assumes the maximum VA size on arm64 is 48-bit) [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/f6795053dac8d4d2f90d4a98842dd6d2ccd544ad|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/363524d2b12270d86677e1154ecc1c5061f43219|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/e5d99157459f79ed26953e8a77addb9d3e0122b7|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/e842dfb5a2d3b4c43766508ef89a4eb67471d53a|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/a96a33b1ca57dbea4285893dedf290aeb8eb090b|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/67e7fdfcc6824a4f768d76d89377b33baad58fad|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/b9567720a1b8e739380e0241413606c056c57859|commit]],
