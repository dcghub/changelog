== Copy offloading with new copy_file_range(2) system call ==

Copying a file consists in reading the data from a file to user space memory, then copy that memory to the destination file. There is nothing wrong with this way of doing things, but it requires doing extra copies of the data to/from the process memory. In this release Linux adds a system call, copy_file_range(2), which allows to copy a range of data from one file to another, avoiding the mentioned cost of transferring data from the kernel to user space and then back into the kernel.

This system call is only very [[https://lwn.net/Articles/658718/|slightly faster]] than {{{cp}}}, because the costs of these memory copies are barely noticeable compared with the time it takes to do the actual I/O, but there are some cases where it can help a lot more. In networking filesystems such as NFS, copying data involves sending the copied data from the server to the client through the network, then sending it again from the client to the new file in the server. But with copy_file_range(2), the NFS client can tell the NFS server to make a file copy from the origin to the destination file, without transferring the data over the network (for NFS, this also requires the server-side copy feature [[https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-nfsv4-minorversion2-41#section-4|present in the upcoming NFS v4.2]], and also supported experimentally in this Linux release). In next releases, local filesystems such as Btrfs, and especialized storage devices that provide copy offloading facilities, could also use this system call to optimize the copy of data, or remove some of the present limitations (currently, copy offloading is limited to files on the same mount and superblock, and not in the same file).

== Experimental PowerPlay supports brings high performance to the amdgpu driver ==

Modern GPUs start running in low power, low performance modes. To get the best performance, they need to dynamically change its frequency. But doing that requires good power management. This release adds support for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_PowerPlay|PowerPlay]] in the amdgpu driver for discrete GPUs Tonga and Fiji, and integrated APUs Carrizo and Stoney. Powerplay is the brand name for a set of technologies for power management implemented in several of AMD CPUs and APUs; it has been available in the propietary Catalyst driver, and it aims to eventually replace the existing dynamic power management in the amdgpu driver. In the supported GPUs, performance will be much higher due to the ability to handle frequency changes.

Powerplay support is not enabled by default for all kind of hardware supported in this release due to stability concerns; in these cases the use of Powerplay can be forced with the "amdgpu.powerplay=1" kernel option.

== Btrfs free space handling scalability improvements ==

Filesystems need to keep track of which blocks are being used and which ones are free. They also need to store information about the free space somewhere, because it's too costly to generate it from scratch. Btrfs has been able to store a cache of the available free space [[http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_37#head-73fc3db571309a002aad2f56e930923422cff5d2|since 2.6.37]], but the implementation is a scalability bottleneck on large (+30T), busy filesystems.

This release includes a new, experimental way of representing the free space cache that takes less work overall to update on each commit and fixes the scalability issues. This new code is experimental, and it's not the default yet. It can be enabled with the {{{-o space_cache=v2}}} mount option. On the first mount with the this option set, the new free space tree will be created and a read-only compatibility flag will be enabled (older kernels will be able to read, but not to write, to the filesystem). It is possible to revert to the old free space cache (and remove the compatibility flag) by mounting the filesystem with the options {{{-o clear_cache,space_cache=v1}}}.

== Support for GCC's Undefined Behavior Sanitizer (-fsanitize=undefined) ==

UBSAN (Undefined Behaviour SANitizer) is a debugging tool available since GCC 4.9 (see [[https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.9.0/gcc/Debugging-Options.html|-fsanitize=undefined documentation]]). It inserts instrumentation code during compilation that will perform checks at runtime before operations that could cause undefined behaviours. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior|Undefined behavior]] means that the semantics of certain operations is undefined, and the compiler presumes that such operations never happen because the programmer will take care of avoiding them, but if they happen the application can produce wrong results, crash or even allow security breaches; examples of undefined behaviour are using a non-static variable before it has been initialized, integer division by zero, signed integer overflows, dereferencing NULL pointers, etc.

In this release, Linux supports compiling the kernel with the Undefined Behavior Sanitizer enabled with the {{{-fsanitize}}} options {{{shift, integer-divide-by-zero, unreachable, vla-bound, null, signed-integer-overflow, bounds, object-size, returns-nonnull-attribute, bool, enum}}} and, optionally, {{{alignment}}}. Most of the work is done by compiler, all the kernel does is to handle the printing of errors.

== Forwarded Error Correction support in the device-mapper's verity target ==

The device-mapper's "verity" target, used by popular platforms such as [[https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot/|Android]] or Netflix, was merged [[http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_3.4#head-011d0bd1a20451b0e374283b36a71d8e8f5b7ae1|in Linux 3.4]], and it allows that a file system hasn't been modified by checking every filesystem read attempt with a list of cryptographic hashes.

This release adds [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_error_correction|Forward Error Correction]] support to the verity target. This feature makes possible to recover from several consecutive corrupted data blocks, by using pregenerated error correction blocks that have relatively small space overhead and can be used to reconstruct the damaged blocks. This technique, found in DVDs, hard drives or satellite transmissions, will make possible to recover from errors in a verity-backed filesystem placed in slightly damaged media.

== Add MADV_FREE flag to madvise(2) ==

[[http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/madvise.2.html|madvise(2)]] is a system call used by processes to tell the kernel how they are going to use their memory, allowing the kernel to optimize the memory management according to these hints to achieve better overall performance.

When an application wants to signal the kernel that it isn't going to use a range of memory in the near future, it can use the MADV_DONTNEED flag, so the kernel can free resources associated with it. Subsequent accesses in the range will succeed, but will result either in reloading of the memory contents from the underlying mapped file or zero-fill-on-demand pages for mappings without an underlying file. But there are some kind of apps (notably, memory allocators) that can reuse that memory range after a short time, and MADV_DONTNEED forces them to incur in page fault, page allocation, page zeroing, etc. For avoiding that overhead, other OS like BSDs [[https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=madvise&sektion=2|have supported MADV_FREE]], which just mark pages as available to free if needed, but it doesn't free them immediately, making possible to reuse the memory range without incurring in the costs of faulting the pages again. This release adds Linux support for this flag.

== Better epoll multithread scalability ==

When multiple [[http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/epoll.7.html|epoll]] file descriptors or epfds (the file descriptor returned from [[http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/epoll_create.2.html|epoll_create(2)]] are added to a shared wakeup source, they are always added in a non-exclusive manner. This means that an event will wakeup all epfds, creating a scalability problem when many epfds are being used.

This release introduces a new {{{EPOLLEXCLUSIVE}}} flag that can be passed as part of the {{{event}}} argument during an [[http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/epoll_ctl.2.html|epoll_ctl(2)]] {{{EPOLL_CTL_ADD}}} operation. This new flag allows for exclusive wakeups when there are multiple epfds attached to a shared fd event source. In a modified version of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enduro/X|Enduro/X]], the use of the 'EPOLLEXCLUSIVE' flag reduced the length of this particular workload from 860s down to 24s.

== cgroup unified hierarchy is considered stable ==

cgroups, or control groups, are a feature [[http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_24#head-5b7511c1e918963d347abc8ed4b75215877d3aa3|introduced in Linux 2.6.24]] which allow to allocate resources (such as CPU time, system memory, network bandwidth) among user-defined groups of processes running on a system. In the first implementation, cgroups allowed an arbitrary number of process hierarchies and each hierarchy could host any number of controllers. While this seemed to provide a high level of flexibility, in practice it had a number of problems, so in [[http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_3.16#head-c8889cafd94fac58408ccc55a02589eda7608eb9|Linux 3.16]] a new, [[http://lwn.net/Articles/601840/|unified hierarchy]] was merged. But it was experimental, only available with the {{{-o __DEVEL__sane_behavior}}} mount option.

In this release, the unified hierarchy is considered stable, and it's no longer hidden behind that developer flag. It can be mounted using the {{{cgroup2}}} filesystem type (unfortunately, the cpu controller for cgroup2 hasn't made it into this release, only memory and io controllers are available at the moment). For more details, including a detailed reasoning behind the migration to the unified hierarchy, see the cgroup2 documentation: [[https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/cgroup-v2.txt|Documentation/cgroup-v2.txt]]

== Performance improvements for SO_REUSEPORT UDP sockets  ==

[[https://lwn.net/Articles/542629/|SO_REUSEPORT]] is a socket option available [[http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_3.9#head-7f858c19da75698842d3571a2424c9b62d3f5b0a|since Linux 3.9]] that allows multiple listener sockets to bind to the same port. An use case for {{{SO_REUSEPORT}}} would be something like a web server binding to port 80 running with multiple threads, where each thread might have it's own listener socket.

In this release, Linux includes two optimizations for {{{SO_REUSEPORT}}} sockets (in this release, only for UDP sockets):
  * Two new sockets options allow to define a classic or extended BPF program ({{{SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT_CBPF}}} and {{{SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT_EBPF}}}). These BPF programs can define how packets are assigned to the sockets placed in the {{{SO_REUSEPORT}}} group of sockets that are bound to the same port.
  * Faster lookup when selecting a {{{SO_REUSEPORT}}} socket for an incoming packet. Previously, the lookup process needed to consider all sockets, in this release an appropriate socket can be found much faster (see the commit link for benchmarks).

== Proper control of socket memory usage in the memory controller ==
In past releases, socket buffers were accounted in the cgroup's memory controller, separately, without any pressure equalization between anonymous memory, page cache, and the socket buffers. When the socket buffer pool was exhausted, buffer allocations would fail and cause network performance to tank, regardless of whether there was still memory available to the group or not. Likewise, struggling anonymous or cache workingsets could not dip into an idle socket memory pool. Because of this, the feature was not usable for many real life applications.

In this release, the new unified memory controller will account all types of memory pages it is tracking on behalf of a cgroup in a single pool. Upon pressure, the VM reclaims and shrinks and puts pressure on whatever memory consumer in that pool is within its reach. When the VM has trouble freeing memory, the network code is instructed to stop growing the cgroup's transmit windows. Overhead is only incurred when a non-root control group is created and the memory controller is instructed to track and account the memory footprint of that group. cgroup.memory=nosocket can be specified on the boot commandline to override any runtime configuration and forcibly exclude socket memory from active memory resource control.

That is, inodes created in the directory will automatically inherit the on-disk inode DAX flag, enabling administrators to set up directory hierarchies that automatically use DAX. Setting this flag on an empty root directory will make the entire filesystem use DAX by default [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/58f88ca2df7270881de2034c8286233a89efe71c|commit]]

= Memory management =
 * pipes: limit the per-user amount of pages allocated in pipes. It is possible for a single process to cause an OOM condition by filling large pipes with data that are never read. This release makes possible to enforce a per-user soft limit above which new pipes will be limited to a single page (4KB), as well as a hard limit above which no new pipes may be created for this user. The limit are controlled by two new sysctls : {{{pipe-user-pages-soft}}}, and {{{pipe-user-pages-hard}}}. Both may be disabled by setting them to zero. The default soft limit allows the default number of FDs per process (1024) to create pipes of the default size (64kB). The hard limit is disabled by default to avoid breaking existing applications that make intensive use of pipes (eg: for [[http://linux.die.net/man/2/splice|splice(2)]]) [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/759c01142a5d0f364a462346168a56de28a80f52|commit]]

 * proc: There are several shortcomings with the accounting of shared memory (SysV shm, shared anonymous mapping, mapping of a tmpfs file). The values in {{{/proc/<pid>/status}}} and {{{statm}}} don't allow to distinguish between shmem memory and a shared mapping to a regular file, even though theirs implication on memory usage are quite different. This release adds a breakdown of {{{VmRSS}}} in {{{/proc/<pid>/status}}} via new fields {{{RssAnon, RssFile and RssShmem}}}. These fields tell the user the memory occupied by private anonymous pages, mapped regular files and shmem, respectively [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/eca56ff906bdd0239485e8b47154a6e73dd9a2f3|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/8cee852ec53fb530f10ccabf1596734209ae336b|commit]]

 * IPv4: Make TCP keepalive settings per-namespace [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/13b287e8d1cad951634389f85b8c9b816bd3bb1e|commit]], {{{tcp_keepalive_probes}}} sysctl knob [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/9bd6861bd4326e3afd3f14a9ec8a723771fb20bb|commit]], {{{tcp_keepalive_intvl}}} sysctl knob [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/b840d15d39128d08ed4486085e5507d2617b9ae1|commit]]
 * IPv6
  * Add a new address generator mode, using the stable address generator with an automatically generated secret. This is intended as a default address generator mode for device types with no EUI64 implementation. The new generator is used for {{{ARPHRD_NONE}}} interfaces initially, adding default IPv6 autoconf support to e.g. tun interfaces [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/cc9da6cc4f56e05cc9e591459fe0192727ff58b3|commit]]
  * Add the support for adding expire value to routes [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/32bc201e1974976b7d3fea9a9b17bb7392ca6394|commit]]
  * Add {{{IPV6_HDRINCL}}} option for raw sockets, it indicates the application provides the IPv6 header on all outgoing data. It's equivalent to the [[https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms738574%28v=vs.85%29.aspx|Windows option]] with the same name [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/715f504b118998c41a2079a17e16bf5a8a114885|commit]]
  * ILA: Add generic ILA translation facility to avoid a big performance hit in the receive path. This table can be configured with identifier to locator mappings, and can be queried to resolve a mapping. Queries can be parameterized based on interface, direction (incoming or outoing), and matching locator. The table is implemented using rhashtable and is configured via netlink (through {{{ip ila ..}}} in iproute) [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/7f00feaf107645d95a6d87e99b4d141ac0a08efd|commit]]

 * Multi Protocol Label Switching: support for dead routes ({{{RTNH_F_DEAD}}} and {{{RTNH_F_LINKDOWN}}} flags on mpls routes). Also adds code to ignore dead routes during route selection [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/c89359a42e2a49656451569c382eed63e781153c|commit]]
 * Enable child sockets to inherit the L3 master device index. Enabling this option allows a "global" listen socket to work across L3 master domains (e.g., VRFs) with connected sockets derived from the listen socket to be bound to the L3 domain in which the packets originated. A sysctl setting ({{{tcp_l3mdev_accept}}}) is added to control the behavior which is similar to sk_mark and sysctl_tcp_fwmark_accept [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/6dd9a14e92e54895e143f10fef4d0b9abe109aa9|commit]]
 * SCTP: dynamically enable or disable "potentially failed" state via a sysctl [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/566178f853c1aa57be9c16007c7cca07df5d51b6|commit]]
 * Wireless
  * Add support for aborting an ongoing scan using the command {{{NL80211_CMD_ABORT_SCAN}}} in the nl80211 interface [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/91f123f20d64c99db0ce8d2bbc5bb82012d3cc1a|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/91d3ab46730379e89e1e908c6f62fbcadb3d8f08|commit]]
  * mac80211_hwsim: Advertise support for VHT IBSS [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/00eeccc4a9a84afe819062df13cdb47159919a7c|commit]]


 * Netfilter
  * nftables: add netdev packet forwarding support. You can use this to forward packets from ingress to the egress path of the specified interface. This provides a fast path to bounce packets from one interface to another specific destination interface [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/39e6dea28adc874f7021e5580c13cab0b58407ea|commit]]
  * nftables: add netdev packet duplication support. You can use this to duplicate packets and inject them at the egress path of the specified interface. This duplication allows you to inspect traffic from the dummy or any other interface dedicated to this purpose [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/502061f81d3eb4518d2e72178e494a8547788ad0|commit]]
  * nftables: add byte/packet counter matching support [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/48f66c905a976bf0ff092fc24f08d9addd82a245|commit]]
  * nftables: Allow to invert limit expression in nf_tables, so we can throttle overlimit traffic [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/c7862a5f0de5f521c545f3436f0aa190964342dd|commit]]
  * nftables: Add support for mangling packet payload. Checksum for the specified base header is updated automatically if requested, however no updates for any kind of pseudo headers are supported, meaning no stateless NAT is supported [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/7ec3f7b47b8d9ad7ba425726f2c58f9ddce040df|commit]]
  * Add cgroup2 support to iptables [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/c38c4597e4bf3e99860eac98211748e1ecb0e139|commit]]
  * meta: Allow to redirect bridged packets to local machine [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/b4aae759c22e71a3c32144f0b3bc4f2fa4aaae98|commit]]
