== Better networking experience with the CAKE queue management algorithm ==

This release includes a new queuing discipline for the network packet scheduler: Common Applications Kept Enhanced (CAKE). It is designed to replace and improve upon the complex hierarchy of simple queuing disciplines  presently required to effectively tackle the [[https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/|bufferbloat]] problem at the network edge.

CAKE targets the home router use case and is intended to squeeze the most bandwidth and latency out of even the slowest ISP links and routers, while presenting an API simple enough that even an ISP can configure it.

== Block I/O latency controller ==

This release adds a new controller that attempts to guarantee minimum I/O latency targets for cgroups. As long as everybody is meeting their latency target the controller doesn't do anything, but once a group starts missing its target it will attempt to maintain average IO latencies below the configured latency target, throttling anybody with a higher latency target than the victimized group. Latency targets need to be enabled in the new {{{io.latency}}} cgroup file, but experimentation is needed to determine the latency targets for a given hardware configuration. For more details see the [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/b351f0c76c3eb94c9ccfb68d0b23899a35e47f27|documentation]].

== Preliminary Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) support ==

This release adds preliminary support in the wireless stack for the existing drafts of the future [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11ax|802.11ax]] standard, also [[https://www.wi-fi.org/news-events/newsroom/wi-fi-alliance-introduces-wi-fi-6|known as Wi-Fi 6]].

== New asynchronous I/O polling interface ==

After being merged and reverted in 4.18, this feature adds a simple one-shot poll through the io_submit(2) interface to poll for the readiness of file descriptors using the aio subsystem. It allows aio poll to work without any additional context switches, unlike epoll. To poll for a file descriptor the application should submit an iocb of type {{{IOCB_CMD_POLL}}}. It adds a {{{io_pgetevents(2)}}} system call, which is the {{{io_getevents(2)}}} equivalent of {{{ppoll(2)}}}/{{{pselect(2)}}} and allows to properly mix signals and aio completions (especially with {{{IOCB_CMD_POLL}}}). The API is based on patches that existed in RHAS2.1 and RHEL3, which means it already is supported by libaio.

== Overlayfs memory usage improvements ==

When users of overlayfs (eg. containers) change metadata on a file, overlayfs makes a copy of the entire file's cache for the upper layer. This means that some actions, eg. doing chown() on whole image directory tree, will increase memory usage considerably. This release allows to delay copy up of data: when file is on lower layer and only metadata is modified (except size), the kernel will only only copy up the metadata and continue to use the data from the lower file until file is opened for writing. Following the previous example, doing chown() on whole image directory tree won't trigger a copy of the file's data, containers will continue sharing the page cache. For instructions on how to turn on this feature, see the [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/d5791044d2e5749ef4de84161cec5532e2111540|documentation]].

This release also properly implements regular file operations for overlayfs, removing several hacks and allowing proper interaction of read-only open files with copy-up, possibility to implement fs modifying ioctls properly, and others. Overlayfs can now act as a POSIX compliant filesystem with some features turned on, for more details see the [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/0c31d675aad949e5dfecf7a32813514423e6c766|documentation]]

== New experimental EROFS file system ==

The new EROFS file system has been added in this release. It is a experimental project, under the staging directory, and still expects to make changes to the on-disk layout. EROFS stands for Enhanced Read-Only File System, and it is a lightweight read-only file system with a modern design (eg. page-sized blocks, inline xattrs/data, etc.) for scenarios which need high-performance read-only requirements, eg. firmwares in mobile phone or Livecds. It also provides VLE compression support, focusing on random read improvements, keeping relatively lower compression ratios, which is useful for high-performance devices with limited memory and ROM space.

Code: [[https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/staging/erofs|source]]

== Better protection in sticky directories (eg. /tmp) ==

This release tries to avoid unintentional writes to an attacker-controlled FIFO or regular files by disallowing open of FIFOs or regular files not owned by the user in world writable sticky directories, unless the owner is the same as that of the directory or the file is opened without the {{{O_CREAT}}} flag. The purpose is to make data spoofing attacks harder. This protection can be turned on and off separately for FIFOs ({{{protected_fifos}}}) and regular files ({{{protected_regular}}}) via sysctl, just like the already existing symlinks/hardlinks protection

Code: [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/30aba6656f61ed44cba445a3c0d38b296fa9e8f5|commit]]

== Intel Cache Pseudo-locking ==

This release adds support for an Intel-specific CPU feature. It allows a user to specify the amount of CPU cache space that an application can fill, it isolates that region of the CPU cache and 'locks' it. From that point on will only serve cache hits. The cache pseudo-locked memory is made accessible to user space where an application can map it into its virtual address space and thus have a region of memory with reduced average read latency. The locking is not perfect and gets totally screwed by WBINDV and similar mechanisms, but it provides a reasonable enhancement for certain types of latency sensitive applications.

== Even more fixes for CPU security bugs ==

This release includes the usual round of patches to deal with the new and exciting CPU security bugs:

 * x86: Add protection against L1TF, aka L1 Terminal Fault, yet another speculative hardware engineering trainwreck. It's a hardware vulnerability which allows unprivileged speculative access to data which is available in the Level 1 Data Cache. For more details, read this LWN article: [[https://lwn.net/Articles/762570/|Meltdown strikes back: the L1 terminal fault vulnerability]]; and/or see [[https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/l1tf.html|the documentation]]
 * x86: Add protection against userspace-userspace spectreRSB
 * x86: Support Enhanced IBRS on future Intel CPUs as the default Spectre V2 mitigation technique instead of retpoline for improved performance
 * Support page-table isolation protection (KPTI) for x86-32
 * Implement syscall wrappers in arm64 to minimize the risk of userspace-controlled values being used under speculation
 * KVM Shadow Paging performance improvements to improve the performance of shadow paging when the guest kernel is using KPTI
 * Support for flushing the count cache on context switch on some POWERPC IBM CPUs (controlled by firmware), as a Spectre v2 mitigation
 * Many small patches across the entire kernel to fix the possible Spectre exploitations warned by GCC

 * BPF
  * Implement cgroup local storage for bpf programs. The main idea is to provide a fast accessible memory for storing various per-cgroup data, e.g. number of transmitted packets. Cgroup local storage looks as a special type of map for userspace, and is accessible using generic bpf maps API for reading and updating of the data. The (cgroup inode id, attachment type) pair is used as a map key. A user can't create new entries or destroy existing entries; it happens automatically when a user attaches/detaches a bpf program to a cgroup [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/0a4c58f5702858822621fa1177c7d3475f181ccb|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/aa0ad5b0391e268bdecf6cda31268388844f8afd|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/d7bf2c10af053191e931b58704cd862fccb7f9de|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/394e40a29788820c9c0526b1c3497c9e0ec2a126|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/3e6a4b3e0289dc9540a2c1d8a20657f4707fbabb|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/7b5dd2bde72cd33313b63cf3ba1de6a9e443a65d|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/cd3394317653837e2eb5c5d0904a8996102af9fc|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/c419cf52da77d0f0f01d4b75a75ae89406f0923f|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/34a6bbb8131b75daeb3e9be026d39d6463762baf|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/f42ee093be2980f2689ea7a170d580364820f48b|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/d4c9f573537506530019c505c8b6097a7d7a5fab|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/68cfa3ac6b8db2782300ad0d699da27aaa2ac9fb|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/28ba068760a7e136a7fe2783bca74e3f43affb9b|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/0069fb854364da79fd99236ea620affc8e1152d5|commit]]

By adding {{{BPF_MAP_TYPE_REUSEPORT_SOCKARRAY}}}, the userspace has total control and visibility on where a {{{SO_REUSEPORT}}} sk should be located in a bpf map. {{{BPF_PROG_TYPE_SK_REUSEPORT}}} allows the bpf prog to directly select a sk from the bpf map [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/40a1227ea845a37ab197dd1caffb60b047fa36b1|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/736b46027eb4a4c602d3b8b93d2f48c9facbd915|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/5dc4c4b7d4e8115e7cde96a030f98cb3ab2e458c|commit]],[[https://git.kernel.org/linus/2dbb9b9e6df67d444fbe425c7f6014858d337adf|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/8217ca653ec601246832d562207bc24bdf652d2f|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/aa5f0c96cc7b96a678779055b2ff4cd9dabd8ba7|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/3bd43a8c91cba0493e507ed7baefa9b5613c28a9|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/6bc8529c414f931ce0acef3099b015cf2f5c4291|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/91134d849a0e8fbc70b8607d280e0d325dcaf7bb|commit]]

  * (FEATURED) Add protection against L1TF, aka L1 Terminal Fault, yet another speculative hardware engineering trainwreck. It's a hardware vulnerability which allows unprivileged speculative access to data which is available in the Level 1 Data Cache.  While Meltdown breaks the user space to kernel space protection, L1TF allows to attack any physical memory address in the system and the attack works across all protection domains. It allows an attack of SGX and also works from inside virtual machines because the speculation bypasses the extended page table (EPT) protection mechanism. A {{{l1tf}}} boot option, with several parameters, is provided to control the mitigations applied by the kernel.

  * (FEATURED) intel_rdt: support Cache Pseudo-Locking. Cache Allocation Technology (CAT), part of Intel Resource Director Technology, enables a user to specify the amount of cache space into which an application can fill. Cache pseudo-locking builds on the fact that a CPU can still read and write data pre-allocated outside its current allocated area on cache hit. With cache pseudo-locking data can be preloaded into a reserved portion of cache that no application can fill, and from that point on will only serve cache hits. The cache pseudo-locked memory is made accessible to user space where an application can map it into its virtual address space and thus have a region of memory with reduced average read latency [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/32206ab36553be8714d9253ce33f4085681d369c|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/cba1aab84fb815675038f9f932c1dd0a5519c63d|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/eb956a636f90bd0297309a7eae6db388ae5bfc43|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/472ef09b40c5802a2e014ae2503ad8619486f9e6|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/d48d7a57f7181b36be748ad8fb806e8de3104e89|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/0b9aa6562650f42da23c29814adc2318c135cef4|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/024d15be3855044faa8bddf829e3613961fd27ba|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/95f0b77efa5749f19e7acfedcb8521da4b13ed0e|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/414dd2b4732949ddc972c2592a13c799434249c6|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/49f7b4efa1101bbc143a960eff3a9c8f9d6f7358|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/9af4c0a6dc1a1abf5336f2c3f951444db6b71da9|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/7604df6e16ae0b4dba6553ae74abcf7280a512fb|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/9ab9aa15c3096000678891b61f7309c8729928e0|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/e651901187ab8bc8a0a969144da6ae0e2e59a148|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/d9b48c86eb380bb272d0ad8f5338d8dc941f3b32|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/e17e733070d4ab312a35848ab248e85b78dcb3f4|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/bb9fec69cb41380428d6b8dab3a303189a9b480a|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/21220bb199f7d65c8f0a63ac7d3209e40fbdd706|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/f7a6e3f6f5ffa4926818ea2b3e8994ecef00b84f|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/125db711e3629977b5e1f06fa066abe6366db294|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/c966dac8a5ede5d5f9b730512d8bdbcec307fe38|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/2a5d76a4fc6469ea9dd6f02fcd4dad3a129bc1c0|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/bbcee99b67c5a8cc4e8037d561be9ed293961fd3|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/e8140a2d13d429364f18ca41b1e4960708c3a40e|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/63657c1cdf89a37d3b69471ad4e5b55c77e86d3f|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/dfe9674b04ff6b819f9105650a008d164d81725e|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/17eafd076291ed23eeb17b28132fa33b0688bc57|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/72d505056604a305a4fcd8b268d2f6e979e17023|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/f2a177292bd052ce12ac453d2ceeb083fe07718a|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/e0bdfe8e36f3fbbdc91e70bf927f743ca23917b0|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/f4e80d67a527469245f391976d8665f934a16205|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/0af6a48da481109affc4ea8295034f69993a91ef|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/37707ec6cba6668f22a47016fdee612b0ff62fe9|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/443810fe6160542c78e24c66047edd7a3cc830c6|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/746e08590b864cf730d7bd23394e2d3fbb0f22b6|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/8a2fc0e1bc0cd856101927188884d7c370b62188|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/f3be1e7b2cf8bc096386a3588fc640b0db6b28d7|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/6fc0de37f663278af160e8e1f0c38b27e6c06206|commit]]

 * Add vkms, the Virtual Kernel Mode-Setting driver. It creates a very basic kms driver with 1 crtc/encoder/connector/plane. VKMS driver would be useful for testing, or for running X (or similar) on headless machines and be able to still use the GPU. Thus it enables a virtual display without the need for hardware display capability [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/1c7c5fd916a0ff66501467f1e8e79d3ff8eca112|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/linus/854502fa0a38dc77c9e855c95d239a8fd50a9b13|commit]]
