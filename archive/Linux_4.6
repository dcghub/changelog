= Prominent features =
== USB 3.1 SuperSpeedPlus (10 Gbps) support ==
USB 3.1 specification includes a new !SuperSpeedPlus protocol supporting up to 10Gbps speeds. USB 3.1 devices using the new !SuperSpeedPlus protocol are called USB 3.1 Gen2 devices (note that USB 3.1 !SuperSpeedPlus is not the same as Type-C or power delivery).

This release adds support for the USB 3.1 !SuperSpeedPlus 10 Gbps speeds for USB core and xHCI host controller, meaning that a USB 3.1 mass storage connected to a USB 3.1 capable xHCI host should work with 10 Gbps speeds.

== Improve the reliability of the Out Of Memory task killer ==
In previous releases, the OOM killer (which tries to kill a task to free memory) tries to kill a single task in a good hope that the task will terminate in a reasonable time and frees up its memory. In practice, it has been shown that it's easy to find workloads which break that assumption, and the OOM victim might take unbounded amount of time to exit because it might be blocked in the uninterruptible state waiting for an event which is blocked by another task looping in the page allocator. This release adds a specialized kernel thread {{{oom_reaper}}} that tries to reclaim memory by preemptively reaping the anonymous or swapped out memory owned by the OOM victim, under an assumption that such a memory won't be needed when its owner is killed anyway.

== Support for Intel memory protection keys ==
This release adds support for a memory protection hardware feature that is available in upcoming Intel CPUs: protection keys. Protection keys allow the encoding of user-controllable permission masks in the page table entries (pte). Instead of having a fixed protection mask in the pte (which needs a system call to change and works on a per page basis), the user can map a handful of protection mask variants. User space can then manipulate a new user-accessible, thread-local register, (PKRU) with two separate bits (Access Disable and Write Disable) for each mask. This makes possible to dynamically switch the protection bits of very large amounts of virtual memory by just manipulating a CPU register, without having to change every single page in the affected virtual memory range.

It also allows more precise control of MMU permission bits: for example the executable bit is separate from the read bit. This release adds the infrastructure for that, plus it adds a high level API to make use of protection keys. If a user-space application calls: {{{mmap(..., PROT_EXEC)}}} or {{{mprotect(ptr, sz, PROT_EXEC)}}} (note PROT_EXEC-only, without PROT_READ/WRITE), the kernel will notice this special case, and will set a special protection key on this memory range.  It also sets the appropriate bits in the PKRU register so that the memory becomes unreadable and unwritable. So using protection keys the kernel is able to implement 'true' {{{PROT_EXEC}}}: code that can be executed, but not read, which is a small security advantage (but note that malicious code can manipulate the PKRU register too). In the future, there will further work around protection keys that will offer more high level call APIs to manage protection keys.

== OrangeFS, a new distributed file system ==
OrangeFS is an LGPL scale-out parallel storage system. Oiginally called PVFS, it was first developed in 1993 by Walt Ligon and Eric Blumer as a parallel file system for Parallel Virtual Machine as part of a NASA grant to study the I/O patterns of parallel programs. It is ideal for large storage problems faced by HPC, !BigData, Streaming Video, Genomics, Bioinformatics. OrangeFS can be accessed through included system utilities, user integration libraries, MPI-IO and can be used by the Hadoop ecosystem as an alternative to the HDFS filesystem.

Applications often don't require Orangefs to be mounted into the VFS, but the Orangefs kernel client allows Orangefs filesystems to be mounted as a VFS. The kernel client communicates with a userspace daemon which in turn communicates with the Orangefs server daemons that implement the file system. The server daemons (there's almost always more than one) need not be running on the same host as the kernel client. Orangefs filesystems can also be mounted with FUSE.

== Kernel Connection Multiplexor, a facility for accelerating application layer protocols ==
This release adds Kernel Connection Multiplexor (KCM), a facility that provides a message-based interface over TCP for accelerating application layer protocols. The motivation for this is based on the observation that although TCP is byte stream transport protocol with no concept of message boundaries, a common use case is to implement a framed application layer protocol running over TCP. Most TCP stacks offer byte stream API for applications, which places the burden of message delineation, message I/O operation atomicity, and load balancing in the application.

With KCM an application can efficiently send and receive application protocol messages over TCP using a datagram interface. The kernel provides necessary assurances that messages are sent and received atomically. This relieves much of the burden applications have in mapping a message based protocol onto the TCP stream. KCM also make application layer messages a unit of work in the kernel for the purposes of steerng and scheduling, which in turn allows a simpler networking model in multithreaded applications. In order to delineate message in a TCP stream for receive in KCM, the kernel implements a message parser based on BPF, which parses application layer messages and returns a message length. Nearly all binary application protocols are parseable in this manner, so KCM should be applicable across a wide range of applications.

== 802.1AE MAC-level encryption (MACsec) ==
This release adds support for [[http://standards.ieee.org/getieee802/download/802.1AE-2006.pdf|MACsec IEEE 802.1AE]], a standard that provides encryption over ethernet. It encrypts and authenticate all traffic in a LAN with GCM-AES-128. It can protect DHCP traffic and VLANs, prevent tampering on ethernet headers. MACsec is designed to be used with the MACsec Key Agreement protocol extension to 802.1X, which provides channel attribution and key distribution to the nodes, but can also be used with static keys getting fed manually by an administrator.

== BATMAN V protocol ==
B.A.T.M.A.N. (Better Approach To Mobile Adhoc Networking) adds support for the [[https://www.open-mesh.org/projects/batman-adv/wiki/BATMAN_V|V protocol]], successor of the IV protocol. The new protocol splits the OGM protocol into two subcomponents: [[https://www.open-mesh.org/projects/batman-adv/wiki/ELP|ELP]] (Echo Location Protocol), in charge of dealing with the neighbour discovery and link quality estimation; and a new OGM protocol, [[https://www.open-mesh.org/projects/batman-adv/wiki/OGMv2|OGMv2]], which implements the algorithm that spreads the metrics around the network and computes optimal paths. The biggest change introduced with B.A.T.M.A.N. V is the new metric: the protocol won't rely on packet loss anymore, but the estimated throughput.

== dma-buf: new ioctl to manage cache coherency between CPU and GPU ==
Userspace might need some sort of cache coherency management e.g. when CPU and GPU domains are being accessed through dma-buf at the same time. To circumvent this problem there are begin/end coherency markers, that forward directly to existing dma-buf device drivers vfunc hooks. Userspace can make use of those markers through the {{{DMA_BUF_IOCTL_SYNC}}} ioctl.

== OCFS2 online inode checker ==
OCFS2 is often used in high-availaibility systems. OCFS2 usually converts the filesystem to read-only when encounters an error, but this decreases availability and is not always necessary. OCFS2 has the mount option ({{{errors=continue}}}), which returns the {{{EIO}}} error to the calling process, it doesn't remount the filesystem to read-only, and the problematic file's inode number is reported in the kernel log. This release adds a very simple in-kernel inode checker that can be used to check and reset the inode. Note that this feature is intended for very small issues which may hinder day-to-day operations of a cluster filesystem by turning the filesystem read-only, it is not suited for complex checks which involve dependency of other components of the filesystem. In these cases, the offline fsck is recommended.

The scope of checking/fixing is at the file level, initially only for regular files. The way this file checker is by writting the inode number, reported in dmesg, to {{{/sys/fs/ocfs2/devname/filecheck/check}}}, then read the output of that file to know what kind of error it has. If you determine to fix this inode, write the inode number to {{{/sys/fs/ocfs2/devname/filecheck/fix}}}, then read the file to know if the inode was able to be fixed or not. For more details see the [[https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/plain/Documentation/filesystems/ocfs2-online-filecheck.txt|documentation]]

== Support for cgroup namespaces ==
This release adds support for [[http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroup_namespaces.7.html|cgroup namespaces]], which provides a mechanism to virtualize the view of the {{{/proc/$PID/cgroup}}} file and cgroup mounts. A new clone flag, {{{CLONE_NEWCGROUP}}}, can be used with [[http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/clone.2.html|clone(2)]] and [[http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/unshare.2.html|unshare(2)]] to create a new cgroup namespace. For a correctly setup container this enables container-tools (like libcontainer, lxc, lmctfy, etc.) to create completely virtualized containers without leaking system level cgroup hierarchy.

Without cgroup namespace, the {{{/proc/$PID/cgroup}}} file shows the complete path of the cgroup of a process. In a container setup where a set of cgroups and namespaces are intended to isolate processes the {{{/proc/$PID/cgroup}}} file may leak potential system level information to the isolated processes.

== Add support for the pNFS SCSI layout ==
This release adds NFSv4.1 support for parallel NFS SCSI layouts in the Linux NFS server, a variant of the block layout which uses SCSI features to offer improved fencing and device identification. With pNFS SCSI layouts, the NFS server acts as Metadata Server for pNFS, which in addition to handling all the metadata access to the NFS export, also hands out layouts to the clients so that they can directly access the underlying SCSI LUNs that are shared with the client. See [[https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-nfsv4-scsi-layout-05|draft-ietf-nfsv4-scsi-layout]] for more details

To use pNFS SCSI layouts, the exported file system needs to support the pNFS SCSI layouts (currently just XFS), and the file system must sit on a SCSI LUN that is accessible to the clients in addition to the MDS.  As of now the file system needs to sit directly on the exported LUN, striping or concatenation of LUNs on the MDS and clients is not supported yet. On a server built with {{{CONFIG_NFSD_SCSI}}}, the pNFS SCSI volume support is automatically enabled if the file system is exported using the "pnfs" option and the underlying SCSI device support persistent reservations. On the client make sure the kernel has the {{{CONFIG_PNFS_BLOCK}}} option enabled, and the file system is mounted using the NFSv4.1 protocol version ({{{mount -o vers=4.1}}}.

= Core (various) =
 * Futex scalability improvements: remove page lock use for shared {{{futex get_futex_key()}}}, which speeds up 'perf bench futex hash' benchmarks by over 40% on a 60-core Westmere. This makes anon-mem shared futexes perform close to private futexes [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/65d8fc777f6dcfee12785c057a6b57f679641c90|commit]]
 * Allow to restrict the default irq affinity mask with the command line option {{{irqaffinity}}} [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/fbf198030e0b027538c290300cfaf9e2efdce122|commit]]
 * Process scheduler
  * Make scheduler statistics a runtime tunable that is disabled by default. As most distributions enable {{{CONFIG_SCHEDSTATS}}} due to its instrumentation value, this is a nice performance enhancement. The way to enable it at runtime is using the {{{sched_schedstats}}} sysctl, or at boot time with the {{{schedstats}}} kernel option [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/cb2517653fccaf9f9b4ae968c7ee005c1bbacdc5|commit]]
  * Add deadline scheduler bandwidth ratio to {{{/proc/sched_debug}}} [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/ef477183d06b0aa41c9e7c02cf5bfec41536e2c4|commit]]
  * NUMA: Spread memory on nodes according to CPU and memory use [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/4142c3ebb685bb338b7d96090d8f90ff49065ff6|commit]]
 * timers
  * {{{Add /proc/<pid>/timerslack_ns}}}. This file allows controlling processes to set the timerslack value on other processes. After setting the slack value on a bash process to 10 seconds, the command {{{sleep 1}}} will last 10 seconds. This functionality is used by power/performance management software, they set the timer slack for other threads according to its policy (such as when the thread is designated foreground vs. background activity) in order to save power by avoiding wakeups (something Android does currently via out-of-tree patches) [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/da8b44d5a9f8bf26da637b7336508ca534d6b319|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/5de23d435e88996b1efe0e2cebe242074ce67c9e|commit]]
  * Support for cross clock domain timestamps, and a new {{{PTP_SYS_OFFSET_PRECISE}}} PTP ioctl interface: Currently, network/system cross-timestamping is performed in the {{{PTP_SYS_OFFSET}}} ioctl, which represents a best effort where the latency between the capture of system time ({{{getnstimeofday()}}}) and the device time ({{{gettime64()}}} driver callback), but at best, the precision of this cross timestamp is on the order of several microseconds due to software latencies, abd sub-microsecond precision is required for industrial control and some media applications. The {{{getcrosststamp()}}} callback and corresponding {{{PTP_SYS_OFFSET_PRECISE}}} ioctl allows the driver to perform better device/system correlation when for example cross timestamp hardware is available (modern Intel systems can do this for onboard Ethernet controllers using the ART counter; which has virtually zero latency between captures of the ART and network device clock). In this release, only the e1000e supports this interface [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/6bd58f09e1d8cc6c50a824c00bf0d617919986a1|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/9da0f49c8767cc0ef6101cb21156cf4380ed50dd|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/ba26621e63ce6dc481d90ab9f6902e058d4ea39a|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/8006c24595cab106bcb9da12d35e32e14ff492df|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/2c756feb18d9ec258dbb3a3d11c47e28820690d7|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/f9677e0f83080bb4186865868c359e72e1fac1ea|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/719f1aa4a67199a3c4c68a03f94e5ec44d9d5f82|commit]]
 * Add two new syscalls, {{{preadv2()}}} and {{{pwritev2()}}}. See the recommended LWN article: [[https://lwn.net/Articles/670231/|The return of preadv2()/pwritev2()]] and the [[http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/preadv.2.html|documentation]] in the Linux man pages; [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/f17d8b35452cab31a70d224964cd583fb2845449|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/97be7ebe53915af504fb491fb99f064c7cf3cb09|commit]]
 * quotas: Add a new quotaclt,{{{ Q_GETNEXTQUOTA}}}. It is like {{{Q_GETQUOTA}}}, except that it will return quota information for the id equal to or greater than the id requested; if the requested id has no quota, it will return quota information for the next higher id which does have a quota set. This allows filesystems to do efficient iteration (today, ext4 with a hidden quota inode requires getpwent-style iterations, and for systems which have i.e. LDAP backends, this can be very slow). Also a analogue {{{Q_XGETNEXTQUOTA}}} command is added to complement {{{Q_XGETQUOTA}}} [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/926132c0257a5a8d149a6a395cc3405e55420566|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/8b37524962b9c54423374717786198f5c0820a28|commit]]
 * Add kcov code coverage. kcov provides code coverage collection for coverage-guided fuzzing (randomized testing).  Coverage-guided fuzzing is a testing technique that uses coverage feedback to determine new interesting inputs to a system.  A notable user-space example is [[http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/|AFL]]. kcov has been used to build syzkaller system call fuzzer, which has found 90 kernel bugs in just 2 months [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/5c9a8750a6409c63a0f01d51a9024861022f6593|commit]]

 * Add objtool, a tool to perform compile-time  validation of the stack frame, living at {{{tools/objtool}}}. It enforces a set of rules on asm code and C inline assembly code so that stack traces can be reliable. This is needed for future projects. Recommended LWN article: [[https://lwn.net/Articles/658333/|Compile-time stack validation]] [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/b9ab5ebb14ec389bd80f66613f1fe3f8f65f2521|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/442f04c34a1a467759d024a1d2c1df0f744dcb06|commit]]
 * cgroup: provide {{{cgroup_no_v1=}}} kernel parameter. Testing cgroup2 can be painful with system software automatically mounting and populating all cgroup controllers in v1 mode. With this boot option it is posible to disable certain controllers in v1 mounts, so that they remain available for cgroup2 mounts. Example use: {{{cgroup_no_v1=memory,cpu}}}, or {{{cgroup_no_v1=all}}}  [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/223ffb29f9723a4b485cacf6dc7e6d639fffc322|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/1619b6d4fdd776b1b91bd288ad6f7e37fe183485|commit]]

  * Introduce new mount option {{{nologreplay}}} to disable tree log replay at mount time to prevent filesystem modification and co-operate with "ro" mount option to get real readonly mount, like "norecovery" in ext and xfs. A filesystem mounted with this option cannot transition to a read-write mount via {{{remount,rw}}} - the filesystem must be unmounted and mounted back again if read-write access is desired  [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/96da09192cda57a356467bd7c91a3641a2e78490|commit]].

 * memory hotplug: Introduce default policy for the newly added memory blocks in {{{/sys/devices/system/memory/auto_online_blocks}}} file with two possible values: "offline" which preserves the current behavior and "online" which causes all newly added memory blocks to go online as soon as they're added.  The default is "offline" [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/31bc3858ea3ebcc3157b3f5f0e624c5962f5a7a6|commit]]
 * dma-buf: Add ioctls to allow userspace to flush. The userspace might need some sort of cache coherency management e.g. when CPU and GPU domains are being accessed through dma-buf at the same time. To circumvent this problem, this release adds begin/end coherency markers that userspace can make use of through the {{{DMA_BUF_IOCTL_SYNC}}} ioctl [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/c11e391da2a8fe973c3c2398452000bed505851e|commit]]

 * BPF
  * Add per-cpu maps, for hash ({{{BPF_MAP_TYPE_PERCPU_HASH}}}) and array maps ({{{BPF_MAP_TYPE_PERCPU_ARRAY}}}), for performance reasons. For per-cpu array maps, the primary use case is a histogram array of latency where bpf program computes the latency of block requests or other events and stores histogram of latency into array of 64 elements. All cpus are constantly running, so normal increment is not accurate, bpf_xadd causes cache ping-pong and this per-cpu approach allows fastest collision-free counters. For per-cpu hash maps, they are used to do accurate counters without need to use BPF_XADD instruction which turned out to be too costly for high-performance network monitoring [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/a10423b87a7eae75da79ce80a8d9475047a674ee|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/824bd0ce6c7c43a9e1e210abf124958e54d88342|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/15a07b33814d14ca817887dbea8530728dc0fbe4|commit]]
  * Add a new map type, {{{BPF_MAP_TYPE_STACK_TRACE}}}, to store stack traces. BPF programs already can walk the stack via unrolled loop of {{{bpf_probe_read()}}}s which is ok for simple analysis, but it's not efficient and limited to <30 frames. In this release the programs can collect up to {{{PERF_MAX_STACK_DEPTH}}} both user and kernel frames. Using stack traces as a key in a map turned out to be very useful for generating flame graphs, off-cpu graphs, waker and chain graphs [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/d5a3b1f691865be576c2bffa708549b8cdccda19|commit]]

  * Faster SO_REUSEPORT for TCP. In the previous release, [[http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_4.5#head-4019f9da871d007609f0fa320a97a7fe5c3e2c99|two performance improvements were done]] for the [[https://lwn.net/Articles/542629/|SO_REUSEPORT]] socket option for UDP sockets. In this release, these performance improvements are extended to TCP: faster lookup of a target socket when choosing a socket from the group of sockets, and also expose the ability to use a BPF program when selecting a socket from a reuseport group [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/fa463497679352c04d201631534955e6be66eef8|commit]], [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/c125e80b88687b25b321795457309eaaee4bf270|commit]]

 * Wireless
  * Add Radio Resource Management (RRM) nl80211 feature flag. Today, the supplicant will add the RRM capabilities Information Element in the association request only if Quiet period is supported, but there are other RRM features that are not related to Quiet (e.g. neighbor report). This solution adds a global RRM capability, that tells user space that it can request RRM capabilities without any specific feature support in the kernel [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/0c9ca11b1ae8eb16c1b6bbae91991392d2321372|commit]]

 * Introduce devlink infrastructure. This release adds a new generic Netlink based interface, called "devlink". There a is need for some userspace API that would allow to expose things that are not directly related to any device class, but rather chip-wide/switch-ASIC-wide stuff.

These nodes correspond to ports on a vswitch created by the logical domains  manager. The created network interface(s) can be used by bridge/vswitch software (such as the Linux bridge or Open vSwitch) to provide guest domain(s) with network interconnectivity or connectivity to a physical network [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/5d01fa0c6bd84ddf1339a3fadfefecd2c28d472e|commit]]

== General Purpose I/O (gpio) ==
 * The GPIO stack has been changed to make the GPIO drivers real devices. For this reason, a new userspace ABI has been created: the GPIO character device. This release takes small steps, so first a pure *information* ABI has been added, along with the tool "lsgpio" that will list all GPIO devices on the system and all lines on these devices. GPIOs can now be properly discovered from userspace (but not be used from userspace). The old sysfs ABI is still available opt-in (and can be used in parallel) and will be maintained around for the foreseeable future, but it will not be extended
 * tools/gpio: create GPIO tools, adds a single example program (lsgpio) to list the GPIOs [[https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/6d591c46bce037696d173bd5c8461b2b4bb680ad|commit]]
